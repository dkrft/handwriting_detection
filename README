# NOTE ON USAGE

This README is a temporary file to facilitate the development and use of the handwriting-detection project. A final README.md will be created when the tools and scripts have been generalized for everyday use.

# ACCESSING DATA
 1. Create a folder (e.g. project) to house the project. 

 2. Create a soft link from your Dropbox folder to a sub-folder known as data:
 	ln -s <DROPBOX_PATH>/Training\ Data/ ./data

 3. Within another sub-folder, clone the github repository:
     https://github.com/dkrft/handwriting_detection

 [In cloned git repository]
 * All data labels are given in the labels/ directory. Files are named based on their most recent checkout date. JSONs come from Labelbox and are processed to make pandas HDF files (with "data" as the key).
